# Copy this file to docker-compose.override.yml and customize for your setup
# docker-compose.override.yml is automatically loaded by docker-compose
# and is gitignored, so each teammate can have their own settings

# For teammates connecting to shared database:
# Uncomment and update the webapp service with the host's IP address

# services:
#   webapp:
#     environment:
#       - ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection=Server=192.168.0.65,1433;Database=WP25G20;User Id=sa;Password=YourStrongPassword123;TrustServerCertificate=True;Encrypt=False;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;Connection Timeout=60;

# For the host (person running the database):
# Keep this file empty or don't create it - docker-compose.yml defaults will work
